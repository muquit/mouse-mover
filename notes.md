Please look at [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md) for details on what has changed in the current version. The binaries are cross-compiled with https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild-go.

Please note: I did not verify win32 version in **mouse-mover-v1.0.1-windows-386.d.zip**, I just cross-compiled it.

To verify checksums: 
```
sha256sum -c mouse-mover-v1.0.1-checksums.txt
```

## Windows 
- 32 bit Intel: mouse-mover-v1.0.1-windows-386.d.zip
- 64 bit Intel: mouse-mover-v1.0.1-windows-amd64.d.zip
